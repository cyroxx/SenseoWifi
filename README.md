# SenseoWifi - Smart Home Coffee Maker

Wifi'ify the Senseo coffee maker.

The coffee maker is with no doubt a central element of our lives.
In the Smart Home where every device is connected and automated, the coffee making can not be left out.
Let's bring the [Philips Senseo](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senseo) (Basic or Classic) into your Wi-Fi and control it remotely from your smartphone, through automation, or by extension via Alexa!

> Yes, this is silly, you should do it too!

## Summary

This project contains information and material regarding:

- Soldering a **custom PCB** needed to bring Senseo onto a Wi-Fi
- Connecting the custom PCB to the Senseo PCB
- Compiling firmware with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (e.g. as plugin in [VisualStudioCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Flashing the custom PCB with the **provided firmware**
- Connecting to Wi-Fi and [MQTT](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials)
- Connecting to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [openHAB](https://openhab.org) or any other home automation solution, including voice assistants like [Amazon Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa)
- Adding a buzzer for **audio feedback** *(optional)*
- Adding a **cup detector** for further automation *(optional)*

## Features

After implementing the steps below your Senseo coffee machine will offer the following new features.
This is especially useful in combination with a home automation system.

- Inform about the current state (Standby, Brewing, ...) of the machine
- Notify about an empty water tank
- Notify about a filled up coffee cup
- Remote control the machine via Wifi/MQTT commands
- Go through a complete brewing cycle automatically (Turn on, brew, turn off)
- Audio feedback via a built-in speaker
- Detect a cup via an optical sensor
- Collect usage statistics, e.g. stored in InfluxDB and visualized in Grafana

## Hardware Modification

The first challenge of this project is to hack the Senseo machine electronics.
You need to solder and connect a custom PCB to the machine.
In the end the PCB will not be visible from the outside, powered from the inside, connected via Wi-Fi and programmed over-the-air (OTA).

**⚠⚠⚠ Attention! For your own safety do not connect AC power while opened up. ⚠⚠⚠**

### Parts

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1× Custom PCB | See [`SenseoWifi-PCB` folder](SenseoWifi-PCB) for schematic |
| 1× WeMos D1 Mini | Microcontroller, [learn more…](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini) |
| 4× Sharp PC817 | Optocoupler interfacing with the Senseo board ([datasheet](https://global.sharp/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/PC817XxNSZ1B_e.pdf)). Thanks to these, the Senseo can be connected to AC power and to your PC via USB at the same time. Try to avoid this constellation and be cautious with active AC power. |

**Power Consumption:**
The question was raised how much energy is consumed by the modification. The PCB consumes approx. 110mA.
Assuming the Senseo machine is connected to power 24/7, the additional electronics raise your electrical bill by 2.00€ per year.

### Steps

1. Solder the custom PCB according to the schematics provided in the `SenseoWifi-PCB` folder (designed in [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org))
2. Hot clue the custom PCB inside the Senseo machine in a free position [such as shown here](images/DSC09604.jpg)
3. Wire the custom PCB via the "Senseo Connections" header (angled pin headers recommended) to interface with the Senseo PCB. The solder pads to use for the LED, the buttons, and ground connection are shown on photos in the `images` folder, e.g., for the [Senseo Classic](images/DSC09627.jpg) and [Senseo Quadrante](images/SenseoQuadrante-PCB.jpg)
4. Connect a simple push button (the configuration reset button) to J3 and hot clue in the [base of the Senseo housing](images/resetbutton.jpg).
5. Connect the additional [power supply](images/DSC09646.jpg) to the Senseo power cable and wire to J4
6. Prepare a [small cutout](images/tcrt-cutout.jpg) in the Senseo front and [hot clue from behind](images/DSC09604.jpg). Connect to the TCRT header
7. Connect a USB cable to continue with firmware programming. Do not connect AC power

Please follow the details given in the schematics and the pictures in the [images](images) folder, which should make everything pretty clear.
Do not hessitate to create a support ticket on GitHub if we missed anything.
A pull request to improve this README is always welcome.

## Firmware Upload

The WeMos microcontroller needs to be programmed with the code provided in this repository.
Be aware that the custom functionality is build on top of the excellent [Homie v3.0](https://github.com/homieiot/homie-esp8266/) framework.

An MQTT broker is needed in your network (e.g. mosquitto).

Please follow these instructions (last tested 2021-10-01):

1. Install PlatformIO via Visual Studio Code as decribed [here](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) or upgrade your existing installation
2. Open PlatformIO and load a latest copy of this repository
3. Connect your Senseo via the USB cable to your PC (do not connect the Senseo to AC power!) and check the devices view of PlatformIO to verify
4. Transfer the firmware and the configuration web interface to the microcontroller.
  The full list of PlatformIO project tasks is:
   - Clean
   - Erase Flash
   - Build
   - Upload
   - Upload File System image
   - Monitor

   If any of the steps ends in a connection error dis- and reconnect the USB cable.
   You were successful when the monitoring terminal shows the SenseoWifi firmware version.
   For initial hardware testing see below.

5. Use a smartphone to connect to the provided Wifi, you will be redirected to a configuration web frontend
6. Provide your Wifi, MQTT, and other settings (we recommend the default homie base topic)
7. Use an MQTT client to inspect messages sent to the MQTT broker.
  You were successful when the message "senseo-wifi" is published to the topic `homie/senseo-wifi/machine/$name`
8. Disconnect the USB cable, close the Senseo housing, and connect the Senseo machine to AC power.
  The machine should once again start communicating via MQTT

**For Hardware testing:** A special piece of code is provided to test that your fresh hardware modifications are working.
Enable `testIO()` in `SenseoWifi.cpp` and check `testIO.cpp` for details.

**Configuration mode:** The configuration web frontend is only available when in configuration mode, i.e. when not yet configured.
Press the configuration reset button previously mounted in the base of the machine for 5 seconds to resets the firmware configuration.
The machine switches in configuration mode and provides a Wifi accesspoint, which upon connection once again presents the configuration web frontend.
Follow these instructions if you ever loose connection, or want to change your Wifi or MQTT settings.

### OTA Updates

After an initial flash with the firmware, updates can be sent via Wifi+MQTT, no need to take the machine apart.
The web frontend on flash and your custom configuration stay on the device.

```sh
python3 ota_updater_202011.py -l 192.168.0.75 -u user -d password -t "homie/" -i "senseo-wifi-rf21" .pio/build/senseo-wifi/firmware.bin
```

## Usage

If everything worked out your machine now communicates its status and accepts commands via MQTT.
You are now ready to interact with the machine and integrate it with other systems.
Please check the source code of `SenseoWifi.cpp` for details on states and commands.

## Smart Home Integration

With the machine connected to Wifi and MQTT, you can now link a smart home system to the important MQTT topics to integrate the machine with the rest of your smart home.

### Home Assistant Configuration Example

The following example integrates the Senseo machine with the home automation solution Home Assistant.
The configuration adds all necessary entities, translations to German, and clever automations to make the machine useful.
E.g. one automation enables a complete coffee brewing cycle with a single command, the other reminds you of your warm coffee every minute while you didn't pick it up.

Please make sure the machine is connected to your MQTT broker and adapt the machine name in the topic.

Home Assistant config file `packages/senseo_wifi.yaml`, see [`home-assistant/senseo_wifi.yaml`](home-assistant/senseo_wifi.yaml).
